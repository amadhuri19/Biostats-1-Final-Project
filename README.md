Analysis of Mental Health Determinants in Hennepin County
Introduction
This study analyzed data from the SHAPE survey conducted by Hennepin County Public Health, focusing on residents' physical and mental health and social determinants of health. It assessed the association between two predictors—basic needs insecurity score (Insecurity2) and healthcare discrimination (Discrim2)—and the number of poor mental health days in the past 31 days (MHdays).

Dataset Overview
Source: SHAPE Survey
Participants: 4539
Variables: 9 (mental health, insecurity, discrimination, demographics)
Objectives
Assess associations between predictors and MHdays.
Develop predictive models using:
Discrim2 (two-sample test of means)
Insecurity2 (linear regression)
Both predictors (multiple regression)
Methodology
Observational, cross-sectional design.
Predictor variables:
Insecurity2: Higher scores indicate higher insecurity.
Discrim2: Binary (0 = no discrimination, 1 = discrimination).
Controlled for demographic factors (gender, race/ethnicity, trans status).
Key Findings
Demographics:

Agender/Genderqueer/Nonbinary, Transgender, and Native American groups reported the highest insecurity and poor mental health days.
Race/Ethnicity was significantly associated with both predictors and outcomes.
Model Results:

Model 1 (Discrim2): Individuals facing healthcare discrimination averaged 6 more poor mental health days than those who did not.
Model 2 (Insecurity2): Weak positive linear relationship; 10.7% variability in MHdays explained after log transformation.
Model 3 (Combined): Both predictors were significant, with an adjusted R² of 0.124.
Implications:

Both predictors are significantly associated with MHdays.
Demographics likely confound relationships, highlighting the need for tailored interventions.
Conclusion
The study underscores the impact of healthcare discrimination and basic needs insecurity on mental health, particularly for vulnerable demographic groups. Future research should:

Include longitudinal designs to establish temporality.
Adjust for demographic confounders.
Explore additional factors for better predictive accuracy.
Limitations
Cross-sectional design limits causal inference.
Low adjusted R² indicates unexplained variability.
Missing data handling not discussed.
Applications
Findings support efforts to:

Promote mental health equity.
Address disparities in basic needs security and healthcare discrimination within diverse communities.
